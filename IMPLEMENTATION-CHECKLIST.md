# Zok Implementation Checklist

**Last updated:** 2026-08-20
**Release state:** FOUNDATION HARDENED / NOT GOLD MASTER

This checklist is the operational companion to `exec-planing.md`. Items may be checked only when current repository/runtime evidence exists.

## Foundation already evidenced

- [x] Canonical runtime documented as Vite + React with Express API adapter.
- [x] Production build command exists.
- [x] Automated tests exist.
- [x] Lint and TypeScript checks exist.
- [x] Production dependency audit is part of CI/release verification.
- [x] Authenticated request path exists.
- [x] CSRF/origin controls exist for mutations.
- [x] Security headers and request-size/rate controls exist.
- [x] Health endpoint exists.
- [x] Local JSON writes are serialized and atomic.
- [x] UI integrations that are not verified are not treated as production connections.

- [ ] Human escalation/approval audit added.

### Production release evidence
- [ ] HTTPS/reverse-proxy production edge verified.
- [ ] Secure-cookie behavior verified behind real TLS.
- [ ] Penetration test completed and findings remediated/accepted.
- [ ] Load/capacity test completed against agreed SLOs.
- [ ] Backup restore drill completed with recorded RPO/RTO.

- [ ] Production canary and rollback evidence completed.
- [ ] Operations/support sign-off completed.

## P1 — Production capability

- [ ] Durable broadcast/campaign worker implemented.
- [ ] Publicly claimed channel adapters implemented and contract-tested.
- [ ] Migration import supports dry-run, resumability, idempotency, and rollback.
- [ ] Attribution event schema and reconciliation implemented.
- [ ] POS/e-commerce provider adapters implemented with replay-safe contracts.
- [ ] Metrics, traces, structured logs, dashboards, alerts, and SLOs implemented.
- [ ] API key lifecycle (create/rotate/revoke) implemented.

- [ ] Data export/delete/retention workflows implemented.

## P2 — Product completeness

- [ ] Onboarding/setup wizard state persisted and resumable.
- [ ] Academy enrollment/completion implemented.
- [ ] Certificate verification implemented.
- [ ] Marketplace ownership/licensing implemented.
- [ ] Marketplace moderation/versioning implemented.
- [ ] Production-backed analytics replaces static metrics.
- [ ] Remaining simulations are either clearly labeled sandbox/demo or backed by real services.
- [ ] Frontend code splitting and performance budgets implemented.

## P3 — Final release polish

- [ ] Accessibility audit completed.
- [ ] Cross-browser regression suite completed.
- [ ] Mobile/tablet/desktop regression suite completed.
- [ ] Documentation consistency audit completed.
- [ ] Release notes prepared.
- [ ] Migration/upgrade notes prepared.
- [ ] Support/operator training material prepared.
- [ ] Gold Master evidence record signed.

## Every execution cycle

- [ ] Read `exec-planing.md` before selecting work.
- [ ] Select the highest-priority bounded incomplete item unless a blocker supersedes it.
- [ ] Add/update tests for implementation changes.
- [ ] Run relevant verification gates.
- [ ] Record residual risks and environment-dependent evidence honestly.
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] Update `exec-planing.md` when status/order/evidence changes.
- [ ] Update `IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md`.
- [ ] Update README/deployment/security docs when behavior or release procedure changes.

## Gold Master rule

Gold Master may be declared only when all P0 items are checked with current evidence and all external Gate D evidence is complete. UI simulations, local mock data, or documentation alone are insufficient evidence.
